| Field              | Value                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Route              | `/regions/[id]`                                                       |
| Status             | In delivery                                                           |
| Pattern            | Federated detail                                                      |
| Primary capability | Revisium-owned fields plus backend-owned fields on one GraphQL entity |

## Purpose

Demonstrate the region detail shell from Revisium-owned data first, then Apollo
Federation once backend enrichment fields are present in the composed schema.

## Context And Entry

- Entry from `/regions` cards.
- Links back to `/regions`.
- Links to related heroes, locations, factions, or monsters if reverse relations are available.

## Functional Blocks

| Block                  | Requirement                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Breadcrumb             | Prominent back button to regions catalog.                                                    |
| Region header          | Name, climate, description, source chips, and required `cover_image` hero.                   |
| Backend stats          | Shows an unavailable state until likes, view count, comments, or approved equivalents exist. |
| Related data           | Optional related locations/heroes once query supports them.                                  |
| Federation explanation | Visible field attribution chips on rendered fields.                                          |
| Explainer Widget       | Required with federation disclosure and SDL excerpt.                                         |

## Primary Actions

| Action                 | Result                                                   |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Back to catalog        | Navigate to `/regions` from a visible back-arrow button. |
| Open cloud row         | Opens the matching region row in `demo-rpg-data`.        |
| View federation source | Opens backend source/SDL link once available.            |

## States

| State                 | Requirement                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Loading               | Stable detail skeleton.                                                                                 |
| Loaded                | Shows Revisium-owned data fields and the backend-unavailable block.                                     |
| Not found             | Region id does not exist or GraphQL returns an id error; link back to catalog.                          |
| Partial backend error | Revisium fields remain visible; backend block shows unavailable state if GraphQL supports partial data. |
| Error                 | Visitor-readable error.                                                                                 |

## Transitions

| From          | Trigger    | To             |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Catalog       | Card click | Detail loading |
| Detail loaded | Back click | Catalog        |

## Data Contract

| Source                | Fields                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data.regions`        | `id`, `data.name`, `data.description`, `data.cover_image.{fileId,url,hash,fileName,mimeType,width,height}`, `data.climate` |
| `backend.RegionsNode` | Blocked until `likes`, `viewCount`, `comments` or approved equivalents appear in the composed schema.                      |

## Explainer Widget

- Summary: "This page shows a Revisium-owned region detail and where backend-owned federation fields will attach."
- Surfaces: GraphQL required; REST/MCP if equivalents exist.
- Variables: GraphQL region id; locale remains visible through rendered field
  state and fallback notes.
- Field attribution: `name`, `description`, `cover_image`, `climate` -> `data`; stats/comments -> `backend` once available.
- Federation: unavailable note until backend `extend type RegionsNode` is present.
- Deep links: matching cloud region row.
- Subgraphs: `data`; add `backend` once backend fields are present.

## Responsive Rules

- Phone: stats stack below header with a floating widget trigger.
- Tablet/Desktop: detail content stays primary with a floating widget trigger; backend stats visible above fold.
- The required `cover_image` renders through imgproxy as the hero media. The
  climate text badge remains the source of meaning when art is unavailable or abstract.
- While the public dev GraphQL response exposes `cover_image` but returns empty
  file objects, `/regions/[id]` may use the same local copies of Revisium Cloud
  draft files as `/regions`. The fallback is secondary to `data.cover_image.url`
  and must be removed once the dev dataset consistently returns file URLs and
  imgproxy can derive them.
- Revisium-owned field rows use subtle hover/focus surface feedback for scan
  affordance, while field attribution remains explicit in the widget.

## Architecture Notes

- Backend enrichment remains blocked until fields are present in the composed schema.
- ViewModel must handle route id, locale, missing row errors, and backend-unavailable state.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Renders Revisium-owned region text fields from GraphQL.
- [ ] Renders required `cover_image` from GraphQL through imgproxy.
- [ ] Required `cover_image` reserves layout and renders without layout shift on phone/tablet/desktop.
- [x] Field ownership is visible in the page UI and widget for data-owned fields.
- [x] Backend-unavailable state is visible while federation fields are absent.
- [ ] Renders at least one backend-owned field in the same GraphQL result.
- [ ] Widget shows federation SDL excerpt and source link.
- [ ] Partial backend failure is handled once GraphQL exposes partial backend fields.

## Open Questions

- Confirm exact backend fields: `likes`, `viewCount`, `comments`, or alternatives.
- Confirm backend source link target for SDL excerpt.
